In this Python script I utilize image masking and kmeans clustering algorithm to segment stop signs in road images. I run
the k means algorithm and then create an image with a square on the boundaries of the stop sign. The images can be found in the
images folder and the resulting images with the stop signs outlined can be found in the results folder.
